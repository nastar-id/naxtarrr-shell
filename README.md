# Naxtarrr Shell Backdoor

This shell is 95% coded by myself and 5% definitely stolen code lmao

* Info Min (Web Info)
* Upload File
* Command

The story behind this shell is 
i wanted to upload shell on a web but I got 403 
(The website uses Litespeed web server).
I tried to upload many shells like 0byt3m1n1, Marijuana, TMP Shell and even obfuscated shell 
but none of them worked, even I just uploaded an uploader I still got 403.

Probably it's because my shells or uploader includes some forbidden keywords or functions. 
Then I make my own shell without those keywords or functions. 
And here I am lol. And of course it can bypass 403 in Litespeed.
